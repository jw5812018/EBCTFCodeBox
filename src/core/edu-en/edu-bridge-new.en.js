/*
 * edu-bridge-new.en.js — English edu shard for the local-bridge / exe bridging ops (pure data, no side effects).
 *
 * Covers 14 bridging ops that "call a local exe / launch a local GUI". These ops are essentially wrappers around external tools:
 * - GUI type (*Launch): only call the bridge /api/launch to spin up a local exe; the user operates manually in the pop-up window.
 *   The toolbox does not feed input or fetch results on your behalf.
 * - CLI type (*Bridge / *Exe): call the bridge /api/run for unattended execution, with files passed in via {placeholder}.
 * Common prerequisites: Windows only, and you must first run python bridge.py locally (listening on localhost:8181).
 * When the bridge isn't running / it's not Windows, the op returns a friendly notice instead of throwing. Zero outbound traffic (connects to localhost only).
 *
 * This file only exports data; it's wired up by the master controller eduContent.js, with no import / register.
