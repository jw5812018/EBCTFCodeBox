    what:
      "Astronomical / zodiac symbols — write celestial and zodiac names as their standard Unicode symbols: " +
      "SUN → ☉, MOON → ☽, MARS → ♂, and the twelve zodiac signs ARIES→♈ … PISCES→♓. It is a name ↔ single-symbol " +
      "character map; use it when a ciphertext mixes ♀♁♂♃♄-style glyphs.",
    principle:
      "The mapping is grounded in the **official character names** of The Unicode Standard character database: each " +
      "code point is uniquely identified by its Unicode name (U+2609 is named SUN, U+263D FIRST QUARTER MOON, and " +
      "U+2648–U+2653 are the twelve zodiac signs in order).\n\n" +
      "Two names disagree with common astronomical usage and are recorded verbatim: U+2640 is officially FEMALE SIGN " +
      "(astronomically Venus) and U+2642 is MALE SIGN (astronomically Mars) — the same glyphs serve both senses, which " +
      "is an existing Unicode fact.\n\n" +
      "Contract: encode splits input into letter runs; each whole word must be a name of the current set " +
      "(case-insensitive); unknown names and abbreviations are rejected explicitly, no abbreviation guessing; " +
      "punctuation and whitespace pass through. decode scans per character: a symbol of the current set maps to its " +
      "canonical uppercase name; a symbol of the other set raises a switch-set error; foreign symbols (e.g. ★) raise " +
      "an error. Historical glyphs of the same body (☀☼ for the Sun, the two half-moon phases, ⛢ vs ♅ for Uranus) " +
      "are accepted as decode aliases.",
    usage:
      "Encode English names (punctuation allowed) → symbol string; paste symbols to decode → uppercase names. " +
      "Pick the set first: planetary (☉☽☿♀♁♂♃♄♅♆♇ plus Ceres/Pallas/Juno/Vesta) or zodiac. If decoding fails, " +
      "check you are on the right set — cross-set symbols produce an explicit switch-set error.",

      "The mapping follows the pip semantics in official Unicode character names: U+2680–U+2685 are named " +

      "Contract: dice mode encodes decimal digits one symbol per digit; 0 and 7–9 are explicit errors (no such faces). " +
      "Domino mode takes digits two at a time; odd lengths, values outside 0–6, back-face tiles and mismatched " +

    usage:
      "Pick the system: dice (1–6, one symbol per digit) or domino (one tile per digit pair); domino mode also takes " +
      "an orientation (horizontal / vertical). Encode a digit string → symbols; paste symbols to decode → digits. " +
